# fewshot-robot-fault
We proposes PTFM for few-shot fault diagnosis in industrial robot transmission systems. By integrating Fourier transform-based frequency enhancement, MLP-mixer-based temporal modeling, and prototypical network classification, the method captures rich time-frequency features while maintaining lightweight architecture.
